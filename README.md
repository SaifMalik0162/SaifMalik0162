# Hi! I'm < Saif Malik />

**Full-Stack Developer | Systems Builder | Product Engineer**

I’m a Canada-based developer focused on building real-world systems — from mobile and web apps to backend services and self-hosted infrastructure. I design end-to-end projects that bring apps, APIs, and data together into complete platforms.

My work spans app development, API integration, and infrastructure, with a focus on making products functional, stable, and real.

## 💼 Experience

I build **full-stack platforms** that run in the real world — from mobile apps backed by APIs, to containerized services running on private infrastructure.

My projects include:
- User-scoped data systems  
- Image & media pipelines  
- Authentication & account systems  
- Self-hosted cloud platforms  
- Mobile + backend ecosystems  

All designed with **persistence, security, and scalability** in mind.
